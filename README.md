# Parliamentary scraper

This script was written to scrape the `docx` of parliament speeches from the
official [website](https://www.lrs.lt/) of the Lithuanian seimas.
This was used for my masters thesis.

Since this was an annoying step to do, the code is publicly available here so
that it could be easier to reproduce.

This code is written quite poorly, but it did the job.
Any suggestions are welcome.
Feel free to use this I don't care.

## Instructions

To set up an environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run:

```bash
python main.py
```
